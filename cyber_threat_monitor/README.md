  - Email Notifications
  - Slack Integration
  - Incident Logging
- **Modern Dashboard**:
  - Real-time Alert Feed
  - Interactive Visualizations
  - Alert Statistics
  - Historical Analysis
- **Risk Scoring**:
  - User Risk Assessment
  - IP Risk Assessment
  - Pattern-based Anomaly Detection

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- iptables (for IP blocking functionality)
- SMTP server (for email notifications)
- Slack workspace (for Slack notifications)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cyber-threat-monitor.git
   cd cyber-threat-monitor
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the system:
   - Edit `config/response_config.json` for notification settings
   - Edit `config/attack_patterns.json` for detection thresholds
   - Edit `config/blacklist.json` for known malicious IPs

### Usage

1. Start the system:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

2. Access the dashboard:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`
